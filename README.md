The source code for my website.

## FAQ
### Why not a static site?
Originally this was built is HTML, but that can be unwieldly when dealing with large tables. To simplify things, it just pulls data from a JSON file to populate data. This is a heavily modified version of [static-pug](https://github.com/CodeHubOrg/static-pug).

### This code is terrible
Yes, I am aware. There is a lot of optimization I could do to improve it, but this generates static sites. Speed and efficiency aren't very important here.
